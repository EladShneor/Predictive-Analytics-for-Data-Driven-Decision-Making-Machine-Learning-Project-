# Predictive Analytics for Data-Driven Decision Making (Machine Learning Project)

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline for data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and classification. It incorporates advanced techniques like PCA and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. The final model achieved one of the top three highest AUC scores during testing in class.

## Key Features

- Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Visualization of categorical and numerical feature distributions.
- Dimensionality Reduction:
  - Applied PCA to reduce feature space while retaining maximum variance.
- Model Training and Evaluation:
  - Implemented baseline models with default hyperparameters.
  - Conducted extensive hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
- Performance Metrics:
  - Evaluated using AUC, with the final model achieving a top-three score in test performance.

## Results

The final AUC score on the test set ranks among the top three, showcasing the effectiveness of the implemented pipeline.
